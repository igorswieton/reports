# reports
Reports is a report management plugin designed for management of single spigot servers alike. Plugin is currently under heavy development, so stay tuned.

## Current supported features
- MySQL support
- Notifications of all players with a certain permission `(check Permissions)`
- Bug-free controlling of a reported player
- Adapted command tab-completion in the chat

## TODO
- Join notifications
- More configuration options
- Pulishing `(Teleport sounds, Bug fixing, Chat clear at control start, ...)`
- Code cleanup (!)

## Permissions
There is only one permission: `report.*`
If a player has this permission, he is able to see, control and close a report.
Everyone on the server is able to report an other player. 

## Installation
Currently there is no way to download the jar file.
In the future, however, there will be a way to download the jar file from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/).
Of course, you have the option to download the repository and build it by yourself via [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
